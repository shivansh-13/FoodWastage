    <h3>Consequences of Food Wastage:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Wasted food contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic Loss:</strong> Billions of rupees are lost each year due to food wastage, impacting farmers, businesses, and consumers.</li>
      <li><strong>Resource Misuse:</strong> Wasting food also means wasting the resources used in producing, processing, and transporting it, such as water, land, and energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Food Insecurity:</strong> While millions of people around the world suffer from hunger, a significant amount of food produced is never consumed.</li>
